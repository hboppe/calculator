# MacBook-Inspired Calculator with JavaScript and Tailwind CSS

This project is a calculator web application inspired by the MacBook calculator, built using JavaScript for functionality and Tailwind CSS for styling.The primary goal of the project was to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts that I recently learned in a course. The calculator's functionality and structure were designed using OOP principles.

The calculator mimics the behavior of the MacBook calculator, including the screen flickering effect when the user clicks on an operation button.

One of the other feature is that when the user presses an operation button more than once in a row, nothing happens on the screen. However, once the user clicks on the equal button, it repeats the last operation. This ensures a user-friendly experience and reduces potential errors.

In addition to the current features, I am planning to add the following enhancements to the calculator:

* Keyboard Support: Users will be able to input numbers and perform operations using their computer's number keypad, providing a more convenient and familiar experience.

* Order of Operations Recognition: The calculator will recognize and adhere to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) rules, ensuring accurate calculations in complex arithmetic expressions.
